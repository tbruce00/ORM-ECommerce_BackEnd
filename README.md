# ORM-ECommerce_BackEnd

## Description

The user is required to first create the e-commerce_db in MySql.

The user is then required to open a CLI in their editor and run npm i to initialize the packages needed to run the application.

The user is then required to enter npm run seed in the CLI to send the data to the database.
